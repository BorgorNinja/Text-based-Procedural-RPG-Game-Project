Python Text-Based RPG Prototype
This Python code is an early-stage prototype of a text-based role-playing game (RPG). The game is at its alpha version 0.1a and serves as a foundation for a more comprehensive RPG experience. Below is an overview of the code and its features:

Options Menu
The code begins with an options menu that allows the player to choose between the following options:

Start Game (Option 'a'): Initiates the game session.
Settings (Option 'b'): Provides the player with settings to configure the game difficulty and choose a starting weapon.
Exit (Option 'c'): Exits the program.
Settings
If the player selects the "Settings" option, they can further configure the game settings, including:

Set Difficulty (Options 'a'): The player can choose a difficulty level from 1 to 3.
Set Equipment (Option 'b'): The player can select their starting equipment from three options: Sword, Staff, or Stave.
Quit Back to Main Menu (Option 'c'): Returns to the main menu.
Game Session
Upon selecting the "Start Game" option, the game_session function is called. However, most of the content within this function is still under development and marked as a "work in progress." The game is expected to include features like character creation, encounters with enemies (Slime, Goblin, Kobold, Dragon, etc.), and equipment management.

Gameplay Mechanics
The code features a simple character and enemy list (character and enemies).
The random module is used to select a random enemy and a random enemy subclass, creating unique enemy names.
The player's starting equipment is determined by the choice made in the "Settings" menu, with options for a Sword, Staff, or Stave.
Please note that this code is in a very early stage of development and lacks substantial gameplay. It provides a basic structure for a text-based RPG, but significant expansion and development are needed to create a playable game. The code includes some placeholder and incomplete sections, which require further implementation.

This prototype serves as a starting point for building a more sophisticated text-based RPG, allowing future development to expand upon its features and gameplay mechanics.
